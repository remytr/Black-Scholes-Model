# Black-Scholes-Model

## Overview
A comprehensive implementation and exploration of the Black-Scholes model for option pricing with multiple numerical approaches and machine learning integration. This repository contains a thorough analysis of the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model, exploring both analytical and numerical solutions. The project examines how different variables affect option prices and implements several computational methods for solving the Black-Scholes partial differential equation including Crank-Nicholson.
